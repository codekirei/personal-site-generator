Welcome to Jamb! Jamb is a static-markup-generator I wrote when building this site. It is different from most other static-site-generators out there because it is only concerned with markup. I prefer using build tools like Gulp or Fly to manage my assets, and Jamb fits very nicely with that workflow.

## Welcome to the show

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes! To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```js
const a = 'this is a constant'
let b = 'this is a variable'
const logger = text => console.log(text)
function foo(bar, baz) {
  let val = bar
  return val * baz + 3
}
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].

<span class="key">CTRL</span>+<span class="key">s</span> is typically the keyboard shortcut to "save". Pretty handy, don't you think? Keyboard shortcuts are great.
